    "where $| \\psi \\rangle$ is the wavefunction vector ket of the particle and $U(t)$ is the unitary time evolution matrix. The matrix $U(t)$ can be found on a computer by using the Crank-Nicolson method. A derivation of this method is contained in [Exercise 9.8 of Mark Newmann's Computational Physics](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/cp/exercises.html) for the free particle case. It is straightfoward to generalize this to a particle bounded in any energy-preserving potential.\n",

At the top left corner of the window is an info box, which displays the Hamiltonian $H$ and the boundaries of our quantum system. At the bottom of the window is the x-scale, which extends from $-0.5$ to $0.5$. Note that this scale and all other units of measurement are not in metric units, but in [natural units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_units), where all fundamental constants are set to one."

To measure observables, click on the `Measure Position`, `Measure Momentum`, and `Measure Energy` buttons. You can also enter a new wavefunction $\\psi(x)$ or potential $V(x)$ in the `Enter Wavefunction` or `Enter Potential V(x)` text boxes. Please ensure that your entry is a function of x and that you hit the return key after. To alter the speed of the simulation, move the `Animation Speed slider`.

    "If you just want a plain Matplotlib animation, you can either run `Animate.py` or import it separately, either through the command line or in a new file. If you import it, make sure that you are running Matplotlib in interactive mode, and that you create an instance of the animation object `QM_1D_Animation`. You can then measure observables by using its methods `measure_energy()`, `measure_position()`, and `measure_momentum()`. To switch between a view of the wavefunction itself or its probability density, use the methods `display_probability()` or `display_wavefunction()`. To change the wavefunction or potential, use `set_wavefunction([new wavefunction])` and `set_unitary([new_potential])`, where `new_wavefunction` and `new_potential` can either be a string or a Numpy array."
