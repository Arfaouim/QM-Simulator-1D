    "where $| \\psi \\rangle$ is the wavefunction vector ket of the particle and $U(t)$ is the unitary time evolution matrix. The matrix $U(t)$ can be numerically computed using the Cranck-Nicholson method. A derivation of this method is found in Exercise 9.9 of Mark Newmann's Computational Physics for the free particle case. It is straightfoward to generalize this to a particle bounded in any energy-preserving potential.\n",

    "Here we see that our wavefunction $\\psi(x)$ takes the form of a coherent state of the Simple Harmonic Oscillator potential. Now in the real world, the wavefunction $\\psi(x)$ is physically unobservable. However, its probability density $|\\psi(x)|^2$ is and you can switch to this view by clicking `View Probability Density`. To measure other observables, click on the `Measure Position`, `Measure Momentum`, and `Measure Energy` buttons. You can also enter a new wavefunction $\\psi(x)$ or potential $V(x)$ in the `Enter Wavefunction` or `Enter Potential V(x)` text boxes. To alter the speed of the simulation, move the `Animation Speed slider`. To close the application, press `QUIT`."

    "If you just want a plain matplotlib animation, you can either run `Animation.py` directly or import it separately, either through the command line or in a new file. If you import it, make sure you create an instance of the animation object first by running something like `Ani = QM_1D_Animation()`. You measure observables by entering `Ani.measure_energy()`, `Ani.measure_position()`, and `Ani.measure_momentum()`. To switch between a view of the wavefunction itself or its probability density, use the `QM_1D_Animation` methods `display_probability()` or `display_wavefunction()`. To change the wavefunction or potential, use the methods `set_wavefunction(new wavefunction)` and `set_unitary(new_potential)`."
