-Check spelling and grammar in the README file
-Since hbar and mass are set to one, just don't show these.
-Degeneracy so far has been ignored. Account for this
 when enumerating the energy eigenstates
-Optimize the Unitary_Operator_1D class
-For the preset potentials, make them independent of the choice
of the box's length and initial position.
-Revise the code for the locate_mouse method.
-Revise the code contained in the QM_1D_Animation class.
-The previous_potential_menu_string attribute in the Applet class
 is most likely not used. Remove this attribute.
-Put an option in the code of whether to output errors or not
 so that the terminal is not spammed with error messages
-If the enter potential by entry fails in the Applet class, don't change the
 potential dropdown menu to its default string value.
-When reshaping the potential or wavefunction and the simulation is paused,
 different Tkinter event attributes are used corresponding to different
 versions of Tkinter. Check that these disparate event attributes
 produce the same behaviour.
-Implement better code for the update_potential_by_sketch method
 in the Applet class
-When updating the unitary operator attribute in the
 update_potential_by_sketch method, use the Animation class methods
 to do this instead of directly manipulating unitary operator class.
-When paused, remove the ability to measure position and
 then measure momentum and vice versa.
-Need to fix a bug where sketching on the far left side of the canvas
 causes the sketches to appear on the far right side
 (this is likely due to the fact that negative indexes loop to the
 other side of the array).
-For powers, add support for ^ instead of **
-Instead of showing '0' when there is no wavefunction, show 'no wavefunction'
 or something similar instead
-Make text labels independent of the choice of coordinates

FUTURE FEATURES:
-Add a conversion back to metric units
-Add some more preset potentials
-Add a scale to the potential
-Add the ability to find the total probability of finding a particle
 in a certain region
-Use the mouse wheel to cycle through the different energy eigenstates
-Use the mouse to construct different functions such as a sinc or gaussian
-Think of other things to do with mouse input
-Make it possible to change the mass of the particle and other constants
-Make a visualization of the energy levels of the potential
-Make the wavefunction viewable in momentum space
-Think of some other basis to view the wavefunction in
-Add time dependant potentials of the form V(x, t)
-Implement this in GTK, QT, etc.
-Add periodic boundaries, if possible
-Add non-reflecting boundaries, if possible
